- Detect overlapping output schedules
- New frequency sensors that use DMA (TBD)
+ Trigger input DMA to circular buffer
+ Refactor decoder trigger interface now that it is synchronous
+ Pluggable generic system for driving these from the main loop
    for non-timing-critical things:
    + Boost control
    + Fan control
    + Idle Control
    + Fuel Pump Control (FP disable when engine stop)
    + Priming
    + Tip in Enrich

- Detect overlapping output schedules on same pin

+ Basic tasks
    + Fan control
    + Idle Control
    + Priming

Safety checks:
 - Validate that buffer swap occurs before its too late
 - We recurse for callbacks, we need a limit
 - More robust scheduler startup -- if first buffer start times are wrong,
   everything is stupid amounts of hard to debug

- Detect overlapping output schedules on same pin
- New frequency sensors that use DMA (TBD)
+ Improve decoder tests to be less brittle on slight config changes
+ Trigger input DMA to circular buffer
+ Refactor decoder trigger interface now that it is synchronous
+ Refactor sensor interface now that it is synchronous
+ Dwell time vs BRV
+ CLT/IAT enrich/timing code
+ Basic tasks
    + Boost control
    + Fan control
    + Idle Control
    + Priming
    + Tip in Enrich

- Implement less of a hack for the trigger ordering fix
- Determine better ADC strategy, the graphs look awful for every-tooth
